# DiseaseCraft (Remastered)

![[DiseaseCraft Logo]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mitchellbrine/DiseaseCraft-Remastered/main/dclogo.png)

After about **five** or **six** ***long*** years ***and a global pandemic*** I am finally returning to this mod. While the source code for the mod will remain closed, this repository will be for all the encylopedic knowledge--as well as demonstrations and updates--needed to play with the new DiseaseCraft.  

### Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Mitchellbrine/DiseaseCraft-Remastered/wiki) for more information once I've reached the beta testing stage.

But, until that time, I'll leave you with this:



```
public void main(String[] args) {

  System.out.println("Hello again, world!")

}
```



Stay healthy,  
Mitchell
